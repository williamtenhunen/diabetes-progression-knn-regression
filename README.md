# From Data to Insights: A KNN Regression Study on a Classic Diabetes Dataset

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the progression of diabetes. I utilize the classic `load_diabetes` dataset from scikit-learn and implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model. The study emphasizes data exploration, preprocessing, and detailed model evaluation.

## How to Run This Project

This project's analysis is designed to be executed in a **Google Colab** environment, leveraging its computational resources. The core logic resides in the Python files within the `src/` directory.

1.  **Clone the repository locally:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/williamtenhunen/diabetes-progression-knn-regression.git
    cd diabetes-progression-knn-regression
    ```
2.  **Open in VS Code:** Manage all your Python files (`.py`) in the `src/` directory using VS Code. Write and edit your code here.
3.  **Transfer `src/` files to Google Colab:**
       * Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/).
       * Create a new blank notebook.
       * In the Colab environment, use the file browser (folder icon on the left sidebar) to upload individual `.py` files from your local `src/` directory directly to Colab's session storage. You'll need to re-upload if you make changes in VS Code.
       * Alternatively, you can open each `.py` file in VS Code, copy its content, and paste it into separate code cells within your Colab notebook (prefixing with `%%writefile filename.py` if you want to create the file in Colab's session).
4.  **Execute the Analysis in Colab:**
    * In your Colab notebook, you will have cells that import functions from your `src` files and then call `main.py` (or individual functions in sequence).
    * A typical Colab cell to run the analysis after setting up paths/uploading:
        ```python
        # from data_loader import load_diabetes_data
        # from preprocessor import preprocess_data
        # from model_trainer import train_and_evaluate_knn

        # # Example of calling functions:
        # X, y = load_diabetes_data()
        # X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(X, y)
        # best_model, metrics = train_and_evaluate_knn(X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled, y_train, y_test)
        # print(metrics)
        ```
    * The `main.py` script (or your Colab cells) should be configured to save any necessary plots to the `images/` folder (which will then be synced to your local repo for Git commits).
